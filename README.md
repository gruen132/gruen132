Hi, I'm Tim! I'm a concept artist with over 4 years of experience, specializing in environment and object design. Beyond art, I've been actively participating in game jams every year, which has fueled my interest in game development and coding.

On GitHub, I occasionally collaborate with friends to contribute to their projects. I have hands-on experience with C#, Python, and Java and enjoy tackling creative challenges through code. Additionally, Iâ€™m adept at writing automated solutions, particularly for Python bots.
